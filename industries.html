<h4>INDUSTRY OVERVIEW</h4>

<p>The Indian pharmaceuticals market is the third largest in terms of volume and thirteenth largest in terms of value, as per a report by Equity Master. The Indian pharmaceuticals market increased at a CAGR of 17.46 per cent during 2005-16 with the market increasing from US$ 6 billion in 2005 to US$ 36.7 billion in 2016 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 15.92 per cent to US$ 55 billion by 2020. India is the largest provider of generic drugs globally with the Indian generics accounting for 20 per cent of global exports in terms of volume. Of late, consolidation has become an important characteristic of the Indian pharmaceutical market as the industry is highly fragmented.</p>
<p>By 2020, India is likely to be among the top three pharmaceutical markets by incremental growth and sixth largest market globally in absolute size. India’s cost of production is significantly lower than that of the US and almost half of that of Europe. It gives a competitive edge to India over others.
</p>

<h4>Talent Challenges</h4>
<p>The Indian pharma industry, which is expected to grow over 15 per cent per annum between 2015 and 2020, will outperform the global pharma industry, which is set to grow at an annual rate of 5 per cent between the same period! This Research &amp; Development oriented industry has a tremendous requirement of people who are sound in technical as well as professional skills. To make this come true, there is an intense need of large pool of talent to develop, discover, manufacture, market and monitor medicines and drugs.</p>

<h4>Industry Snapshot</h4>

<p>The Engineering sector is the largest industrial sector in the country and can be broadly categorised into two segments - heavy engineering and light engineering. The Indian engineering sector continues to grow on account of robust internal consumption, which has encouraged both inbound as well as outbound cross border Mergers &amp;Acquisitions (M&amp;A). The sector, long dominated by heavy engineering, is highly structured and technology driven.</p>

<p>Engineering exports have seen a robust performance in recent years. In 2010-11, engineering exports reached US$ 60 billion. The next decade in Indian engineering sector belongs to power and energy, mining, water and sewage treatment and port infrastructure. The planned infrastructure spending for the five year plan ending in 2012 has been targeted at US$ 500 billion, which is likely to be doubled to US$1 trillion in the following planning period. This planned infrastructure spending is across all core sectors which directly influence the engineering sector. </p>

<h4>Talent Challenges</h4>

<p>India ranked second in global manufacturing competence in 2010, according to a report by Deloitte. The country will be gaining an even stronger foothold on this position over the next five years. India’s rich talent pool of scientists, researchers, and engineers, as well as its large, well-educated English-speaking workforce and democratic regime make it an attractive destination for manufacturers.</p>

<h4>INDUSTRY OVERVIEW</h4>

<p>Human resources is the department or division of a business, corporation, or organization that manages all aspects related to its personnel, including recruiting employees, training and career development, overseeing compensation packages, managing benefits plans, and other duties that serve to maximize a company's business and its employees' satisfaction with their jobs.</p>

<p>As an increasingly potent portion of the Indian economy has come to depend on service industries, the growth of the human resources (HR) industry has increased proportionally. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, globalization has complicated the HR role, creating new challenges, such as managing employees and overseeing employee regulations in different countries and cultures, while technology has created a new array of opportunities for streamlining HR administration and practice-everything from putting benefits programs online to e-learning to automating payroll and other administrative HR tasks.

<h4>Talent Challenges</h4>

<p>In other words, HR doesn't consist of a single activity or function but a huge network of them; basically, HR refers to everything related to the employer-employee relationship. Both specialists and generalists can find a home here, with specialist tracks ranging from training to pension plan administration to legal compliance. In HR, there's something for just about everyone. Fetching correct talent, that has keen understanding about employee relations and has strong communication skills and a high level of emotional intelligence, is of utmost importance since the entire system of any business is dependent on the HR.</p>

<h4>INDUSTRY OVERVIEW</h4>

<p>Information Technology (IT) is playing a significant role in the growth and development of Indian economy because of its empirical characteristics that apply at the current time. The sector envelopes software solutions, hardware, IT services, engineering and R&amp;D services and ITES (IT-enabled services). For last 20 years, the Indian IT/ITES industry has contributed significantly to Indian economic growth in terms of GDP, foreign exchange earnings and employment generation. The industry has been the trigger for many "firsts" and has contributed not only to unleashing the hitherto untapped entrepreneurial potential of the middle class Indian but also taking Indian excellence to the global market. The unprecedented achievements of ITES sphere and favourable business environment, armed with skilled manpower and cost arbitrage, attracted various companies to establish their IT and back offices in India.</p>
<p>The IT industry in India is considered employment creator that is generating jobs over the years exponentially. Nasscom is able to graph its growth projection of 16-18 per cent for the sector in this fiscal. Indian IT companies, like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, are trying to give tough competition to giant global firms such as IBM, Accenture and EDS for large mandates.

<h4>Industry Snapshot</h4>

<p>The Indian FMCG sector is the fourth largest sector in the economy with a total market size of more than US$ 13.1 billion. The sector is set to treble from US$ 11.6 billion in 2003 to US$ 33.4 billion in 2015. The FMCG sector in India has been experiencing an exceptional pace of growth since last decade on the back of rising consumer income and rapidly changing consumer tastes and preferences.</p>

<p>The market is highly fragmented with almost 50 per cent share with the unbranded, unpackaged home made products. This presents a tremendous opportunity for makers of branded products who can convert these consumers to become loyal users of their products. </p>


<h4>Talent Challenges</h4>

<p>The FMCG sector continues to face the war for talent, with the number of people with disposable income growing every year. Indian FMCG professionals in the marketing field are considered the best, with many of them leading organisations worldwide. Sales &amp; marketing professionals from FMCG companies have been poached by companies from sectors such as telecom, textiles, pharmaceuticals and automobiles, and the trend is likely to continue. FMCG professionals are much sought after as they bring with them specific skills which can effectively drive business transformation.</p>

<h4>Industry Snapshot</h4>

<p>The automobile industry in India is one of the largest as well as fastest growing automobile industries in the world. In recent years, India has become a major auto hub and emerged as an important global manufacturing base for automobile companies as it provides low cost production opportunities along with an added advantage of having a well trained workforce at competitive costs. Numerous global automotive giants are upbeat about their expansion plans in India and are willing to enter into partnerships with domestic companies to produce automobiles.</p>

<p>During 2010-11, the Indian automotive industry registered a total turnover of US$ 73 billion, with exports worth US$ 11 billion. Of this, the turnover by the auto component sector stood at US$ 30 billion, with exports valued at US$ 5 billion. The sector is expected to witness high levels of growth on account of drivers such as low level of vehicle penetration, growth of the economy, the demographic profile of the country, increasing wages and salaries, and huge investments being made by the government in the infrastructure sector. It is forecasted that the Indian auto component industry has the potential reach a turnover level of US$ 66.4 billion by 2016 and US$ 113 billion by 2020, signifying a fourfold increase over a period of ten years. </p>

<h4>Talent Challenges</h4>
<p>The industry's highly competitive environment translates into a strong demand for senior management who can successfully steer companies through challenging times. The industry requires change management skills as well as an ability to create innovative middle and long-term strategies. However the availability of skilled manpower is gradually beginning to fall short of the industry’s requirements and this could have an impact on the future growth trends. </p>

<h4>Industry Snapshot</h4>

<p>The emergence of innumerable TV channels and private FM radio operators has made entertainment and information available across the entire Indian landscape. </p>

<p>The Media and Entertainment sector in India, which includes sectors such as television, music, radio and print, is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 13.2% to reach a size of Rs 1.19 lakh crore by 2015, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). In 2010, the Indian industry grew by 11.2 per cent, one of the highest growth rates in the world, due to improved economic conditions and rebound in advertising.</p>


<h4>Talent Challenges</h4>

<P>Amidst the major challenges faced by the industry are threats from piracy and violation of intellectual property rights, lack of quality content, and lack of cohesive production and distribution infrastructure. In a bid to constantly think of new and innovative ways to keep themselves ahead of their competitors, companies are increasingly focusing on their quality of talent. However, the sector continues to reel under challenges of paucity and mismanagement of talent and lack of standardisation across levels with regards to salaries and designations. The demand supply gap particularly with regards to "right" creative content talent is another chronic trend.</P>
