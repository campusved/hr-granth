<p>Recruitment Process Outsourcing or RPO is a type of recruitment solution designed to reduce recruitment costs, produce efficiency, and raise the standard of talent across an enterprise. RPO ensures that recruiting must also be systematized, cost-efficient, and comply with all company policies and employment laws. The metrics to evaluate the efficacy of these solutions are typically the total quality and performance of sourced employees, employee churn and turnover, and the reach and quantity of developed talent databases or other external candidate communications.</p>
